# Alternative Splicing in Embryonic Mouse Cells

Goal is to write a pipeline that can cluster data based on similarities withing dataset E8.5, and to find a suitable analysis method for the determination of alternative splicing of RNA. 



## Phase 1 Data inspection & clustering with Seurat
Clustering data in dataset E8.5 with package [@satijalab/seurat](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat)


- [Seurat_pipeline](https://github.com/ProjecticumDlerpDs/Splicing_mouse/tree/main/scripts/Finished/Seurat_pipeline)

## Phase 2 Transcriptome identification & Quantification with Whippet
Whippet package [@timbitz/Whippet.jl](https://github.com/timbitz/Whippet.jl)
Fase 2 not reached yet



## Data
 
Datasets are stored withing the Rstudio Server "/home/data/projecticum/splicing/data"

## Analysis

Pipeline and analysis with the following packages
